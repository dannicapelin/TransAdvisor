<p>TransAdvisor was created for trans people by a collaboration of trans people and trans allies who have an interest in building software solutions to make trans peopleâ€™s lives easier. It came into being at Trans*Code, in March 2015. </p>


<p>TransAdvisor is designed to help people who fall under the trans umbrella make choices about the healthcare providers they access by providing reviews of how trans-friendly a healthcare provider or institution is, according to trans people who have accessed that service. Trans people can then find out how trans-friendly their local health services are before they visit, and potentially switch healthcare providers based on reviews of both individuals and institutions.</p>
